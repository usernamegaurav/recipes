Procedure
______________________________________________________________________
To start the chai, combine the milk and water in a pot over medium heat.
*Note: For a non-dairy Chai, use either almond milk, coconut milk or soy milk instead of regular milk.
Add the cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, star anise, cloves, whole peppercorns, ground ginger, orange peel, and sugar. Whisk everything together and let it come to a slight boil, then turn down the heat and let it simmer for about 5 minutes.
Bring it back up to a boil and add the teabags. Turn off the heat and let steep for about 2 or 3 minutes. Once steeped, strain the chai and serve.
